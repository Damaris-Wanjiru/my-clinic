            <h1>Be Sweet to Your Feet: 7 Tips for Good Foot Health</h1>
        <p>posted by Damaris | Date April 11, 2024</p>

        <p>April is National Foot Health Awareness Month. Put your best foot forward with these easy tips for at home foot care.</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep feet clean and dry. Wash your feet every day and dry completely.</li>
                <li>Check feet regularly for cuts, sores, swelling, dryness, and infected toenails. Apply treatment as needed.</li>
                <li>Don’t wear the same pair of shoes for two or more days in a row. Allow shoes to dry out before wearing again. <br>
                    Change socks daily.</li>
                <li>Choose the right shoes. Avoid narrow shoes that squeeze toes together and high heels. Narrow shoes can squeeze <br>
                     the foot and aggravate deformities such as bunions or hammertoes.</li>
                <li>If you have foot issues, choose lace-up shoes over slip-ons. Lace-ups provide increased adjustability for a <br>
                    snugger fit that reduces friction, as well as offering more stability to the heel.</li>
                <li>Trim toenails straight across. Cut them so you can see a bit of skin just above the nail edge. If you trim them  <br>
                    in a curve or too short, the edge of the nail may grow into the skin and cause an ingrown toenail. Don’t let <br>
                    toenails grow so long that they extend past your toes.</li>
                <li>If visiting a salon for foot care, choose one that is clean and licensed by the state cosmetology board. Nail clippers, <br>
                     scissors, and other tools should be sterilized after each use.</li>
            </ol></p>
