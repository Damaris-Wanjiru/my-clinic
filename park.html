            <p>April is Parkinson’s Awareness Month. According to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, an <br>
                estimated 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide are affected by Parkinson’s <br>
             disease. Wojciech Gryc, MD, with Valley’s Neuroscience Institute explains what Parkinson’s is, its symptoms and diagnosis, and  <br>
                  some common misconceptions about the disease in this DocTalk video.</p>
                  <h3> What is Parkinson’s disease?</h3>
                  <p>Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder that affects movement. It is due to the loss of nerve cells that are used when our <br>
                     bodies make the chemical messenger (in the brain) called dopamine. Dopamine is very important in regulating and controlling movement. <br>
                      We do not know what exactly causes this nerve loss, but there’s a lot of research looking into that.</p>
                  <h3>| What are the main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and how may they vary between individuals?</h3>
                  <p>The main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include things like tremors (shaking of part of the body), rigidity (stiffness in the body),  <br>
                    bradykinesia (slowing of the body), postural instability or gait issues (how a person walks), and balance problems. However, symptoms <br>
                     and their progression can vary from person to person, caused by a range of factors and conditions.</p>
                  <h4>What are common misconceptions about Parkinson’s disease?</h4>
                  <p><ul>
                    <li><b>Age:</b>A widespread misconception is that Parkinson’s only affects the elderly. In reality, it can also occur in younger people, <br>
                        highlighting the importance of early diagnosis.</li>
                    <li><b>Genetics:</b> Another misunderstanding is viewing Parkinson’s mainly as a genetic disorder. While there are genetic cases, most <br> 
                        are rare. This means that just because a person has Parkinson’s disease doesn’t mean that their children or other family members will <br>
                         develop it.</li>
                    <li><b>Symptom Range:</b> Many believe Parkinson’s only affects physical symptoms, such as tremors and stiffness. However, it also it can  <br>
                        also include gastrointestinal issues, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, or cognitive changes.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <h3> What are the current treatment options for Parkinson’s disease?</h3>
                  <p>Our current treatments primarily aim to manage symptoms. This includes medications to either replenish or mimic the effects of dopamine,<br> 
                    physical therapy for mobility, and, in certain cases, surgeries like deep brain stimulation (DBS) to enhance quality of life.</p>
                  <h3>What advances in treatment have been made in recent years?</h3>
                  <p>Recent advancements in treatment of Parkinson’s disease include new medications that can control the symptoms for a longer period of time <br> 
                    and decrease the side effects. New surgical options and implantable devices have been used to improve the functioning, the effectiveness of <br> 
                    the medication, and to increase the independence of people with Parkinson’s disease. There has been a focus on holistic approaches and tailored <br>
                    treatments to focus on patients’ personal needs and conditions. Research also includes gene therapy, and stem cells. </p>
                  <h3> What factors contribute to a better quality of life for patients with Parkinson’s disease?</h3>
                  <p>A multi-disciplinary approach to treatment of Parkinson’s disease in patients is very important. This involves neurologists, physical therapists,<br> 
                    occupational therapists, and even mental health providers who can enhance the well-being of patients. Physical exercise, well-balanced diet, and <br> 
                    staying active with support groups, family members, and friends can also improve the functioning and well-being of patients.</p>
                  <h3> If you or your loved one has symptoms, what should you do next?</h3>
                  <p>If you or a loved one notice symptoms like tremors or stiffness, consulting a primary care provider is a critical first step. Early treatment <br> 
                    can significantly benefitlong-term management and outcomes.</p>
