    </div>

             shopping mall in Lenox after leaving Canyon Ranch.[21]

            Damaris is one of the most prominent proponents of functional medicine,[22] <br>
             a controversial form of alternative medicine;[8][9] <br>
             there is no  definitive clinical evidence of its effectiveness.[23] She is the board president of clinical affairs of the <br>
            Institute for Functional Medicine,[6][10][11] and is a contributing editor and former editor-in-chief to the journal Alternative <br>

        <h2>Peganism</h2>
        <p>Damaris endorsed a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet in his books Eat Fat Get Thin and The Eat Fat, Get Thin Cookbook, published in 2021. In these books,<br>
        Damaris disputes commonly held ideas about consuming dietary fat.[35] She says that saturated fat does not cause heart disease and obesity; processed <br>
        carbohydrates do.[35][36][37] Damaris recommends her readers transition to a pegan diet.[35][36]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="body4">
        <h2>Reception</h2>
        <p>Peganism has been termed by some dietitians as a fad diet.[13][14] The diet's emphasis on vegetables and omega-3 fats is in accord to mainstream  <br>
            nutrition advice but has been criticized for limiting the consumption of beans and whole grains, which are associated with multiple health benefits  <br>
            such as reducing cardiovascular disease and cancer risk and supporting weight management.[13][41] The pegan diet is restrictive and may cause magnesium, <br>
            iron or calcium deficiency. Dietitian Abbey Sharp has commented that it "would be shocking to me if anyone was able to maintain this diet in the long  <br>
            run without incurring serious psychological damage".[4</p>
